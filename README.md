## Behind the Scenes

1. **User Input**: To get started, the application collects input from the user regarding their current emotional state or the type of movie genre they wish to watch. You can express your emotions through a text input or choose a specific movie genre from the provided options.

2. **Emotion Encoding**: The emotions provided by the user are then sent to our Language Model (LLM). The LLM skillfully interprets and encodes these emotions, ensuring an accurate representation.

3. **Similarity Search**: Using the encoded emotions, MovieMuse performs a similarity search within our vector database, known as the "DeepLake Vector Store in LangChain." This vector database contains emotional embeddings of the top 1000 movies on IMDB.

4. **Movie Selection**: From the pool of movies with the highest similarity scores, the app randomly selects a movie to recommend. To make the selection process more intuitive, the algorithm gives preference to movies with higher similarity scores, ensuring that the recommendation closely aligns with your emotional state or preferred genre.

5. **Movie Details**: Once the movie recommendation is generated, MovieMuse displays essential details about the chosen movie, including its title, genre, and IMDb rating. You will also find a brief summary and trailer to help you make an informed decision.
