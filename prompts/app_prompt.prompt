We have a movie recommendation system. It accepts 8 genres or emotions. You are tasked to suggest between 1 and 4 genre/emotions to match the users mood. Suggest more emotions for longer sentences and just one or two for small ones, trying to condense the main theme of the input


Please, suggest emotions for input = "{user_input}", reply ONLY with a list of emotions/feelings/vibes
